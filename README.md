# OllamaUtil

A command-line utility to manage the Ollama cache, making it easier to maintain and move Ollama models between different storage locations. Useful for managing models across internal and external storage.

## Features

- List installed Ollama models with details about their storage location (internal/external cache)
- Toggle between internal and external Ollama cache directories using symbolic links
- Migrate model files between internal and external caches with:
  - SHA-256 checksum validation
  - Progress bars for large files
  - Metadata preservation
  - Blob file handling
- Remove models from either or both caches
- Pull models from Ollama.com
- Push models to Ollama.com (personal repositories only)
- Supports multiple model tags and versions

## Installation

From PyPI:
```bash
pip install ollamautil
```

From source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ollamautil.git
cd ollamautil
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables before using:

# Optional: List of files to ignore (defaults to [".DS_Store"])
